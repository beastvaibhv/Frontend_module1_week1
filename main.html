                <img src="https://www.fabhotels.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Mindrolling-Monastery.jpg" alt="buddha temple">
                <p>The Buddha Temple, also known as Mindrolling Monastery, was founded in 1965 by His Eminence Kochen Rinpoche and a 
                    small group of other monks in Tibet to preserve and spread Buddhist teachings and culture.
                     The Buddha Temple complex, one of the four Tibetan religious schools, was built in the Japanese 
                     architectural style and has a 103-foot-tall statue of the Lord Buddha. Nyingma is the name of the temple 
                     complex, whereas Kagyu, Sakya, and Geluk are the names of the schools housed there. There are statues of 
                     Buddha and Guru Padmasambhava on all five of the temple’s levels, which rise to a height of approximately 
                     220 feet. It is one of the best places to see in Dehradun to experience and learn about Tibetan Culture.
